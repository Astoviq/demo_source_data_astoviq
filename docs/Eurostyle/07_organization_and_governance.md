# Organization and Governance

## Roles and Responsibilities (RACI)
- Data Governance: defines glossary, owners, quality rules
- Finance: owns financial KPIs and reconciliation
- Operations: owns order, inventory, fulfillment KPIs
- HR: owns workforce metrics and privacy controls
- E‑commerce & Marketing: owns digital KPIs and attribution
- Retail Ops: owns POS performance and store excellence

## KPI Ownership
- Each KPI lists an owner_role; quarterly review of definitions/targets
- Changes tracked via document revision history

## Document Control (Pattern)
- Version, owner, approval, effective date metadata in front‑matter
- Confidentiality tag: Public/Internal/Confidential
- Archive superseded versions in an `archive/` folder if replaced

## Compliance
- GDPR: consent, masking, retention
- VAT/IFRS: correct rates, accounts, double‑entry integrity
- Security: PCI for payment data; least privilege for access
