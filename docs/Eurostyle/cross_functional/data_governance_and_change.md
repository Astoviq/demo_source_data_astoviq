# Data Governance & Change Management

## Policies
- Single source of truth per entity (Ops, POS, Finance, HR, Webshop)
- Controlled vocabularies (see Business Glossary)
- Privacy by design (GDPR), financial controls (IFRS, VAT)

## Change Process
- RFC with impact assessment (systems, KPIs, docs)
- Data model changes require glossary update and owner sign‑off
- Documentation synchronization required with every change

## Quality
- Data profiling and validation rules per domain
- KPI definition stewardship with named owners

## Access
- Role‑based access; least privilege; audit logging

## Review Cadence
- Quarterly governance review; monthly KPI definition checks
