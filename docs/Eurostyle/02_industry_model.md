```

## Business Capability Mapping → Systems
- Operational (ERP): customers, products, orders, stores, pricing, inventory
- Webshop: sessions, events, conversions, attribution, campaigns
- POS: transactions, items, payments, employee attribution
- Finance: legal entities, chart of accounts, journals, closing
- HR: employees, departments, contracts, performance
- Future (conceptual): purchasing, supply chain, WMS, CRM, supplier risk

## Cross-Domain Considerations
- GDPR: personal data minimization, consent, retention
- VAT: country rates and correct GL mapping
- IFRS: consolidation, audit trails, monthly close discipline
- Sustainability: product scores, materials, footprint (where captured)

## Drivers and Risks
- Demand volatility and seasonality
- Inventory health: stock-outs vs. overstock
- Price/margin management and discount leakage
- Workforce productivity and staffing mix
- Compliance (VAT, GDPR) across markets
