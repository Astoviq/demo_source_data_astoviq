# Configuration-Driven Database Status System

## Overview

The EuroStyle Retail Demo system has been updated to use a configuration-driven approach for database status reporting, eliminating hardcoded database names and enabling automatic discovery of all databases from the YAML configuration.

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: The `eurostyle_pos` database was missing from status reports because database names were hardcoded in both:
- `scripts/utilities/system_status.sh` 
- `eurostyle.sh` (cmd_status function)

**Root Cause**: Hardcoded arrays that only included 4 of the 5 EuroStyle databases.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Configuration-Driven Helper
Created `scripts/utilities/helpers/read_eurostyle_dbs.py`:
- Reads database definitions from `config/environments/development.yaml`
- Outputs `name|description` pairs for all `eurostyle_*` databases
- Includes safety check to ensure `eurostyle_pos` is always included
- Follows framework principles (no hardcoding)

### 2. Updated Scripts
**Both status scripts now use dynamic database discovery:**

#### system_status.sh
- Replaced hardcoded `declare -A databases` with configuration-driven approach
- Uses `mapfile -t DB_ENTRIES < <(python3 read_eurostyle_dbs.py)`
- Maintains existing output format for compatibility

#### eurostyle.sh  
- Added missing `POS_DB="eurostyle_pos"` variable
- Refactored `cmd_status()` to use configuration helper
- Includes fallback to hardcoded list (now with POS) if helper unavailable

### 3. Archived Legacy Code
Following corporate rules, archived original files to:
- `scripts/utilities/archive/system_status_20241013.sh`

## Results

### Before Fix
```
🗃️ Database Status:
  ✅ eurostyle_operational: 118180 records
  ✅ eurostyle_webshop: 25000 records  
  ✅ eurostyle_finance: 58918 records
  ✅ eurostyle_hr: 13287 records
```

### After Fix  
```
🗃️ Database Status:
  ✅ eurostyle_finance: 58918 records
  ✅ eurostyle_hr: 13287 records
  ✅ eurostyle_operational: 118180 records
  ✅ eurostyle_pos: 14216 records        ← NOW INCLUDED!
  ✅ eurostyle_webshop: 25000 records
```

## Configuration Structure

The system reads from `config/environments/development.yaml`:

```yaml
clickhouse:
  databases:
    - name: "eurostyle_operational"
      description: "Customer orders, products, stores, inventory"
    - name: "eurostyle_finance"  
      description: "General ledger, budgets, entities, depreciation"
    - name: "eurostyle_hr"
      description: "Employees, contracts, performance, leave management"
    - name: "eurostyle_webshop"
      description: "Web analytics, sessions, events, campaigns"
    - name: "eurostyle_pos"
      description: "Point of sales transactions, employee assignments, payments"
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Discovery**: New databases added to config are automatically detected
2. **No Hardcoding**: Follows WARP.md framework principles  
3. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth in YAML configuration
4. **Robust**: Includes fallback mechanisms and error handling
5. **Complete Coverage**: All 5 databases now appear in status reports

## Usage

```bash
# Standard status check (now shows all 5 databases)
./eurostyle.sh status

# Detailed system status  
./scripts/utilities/system_status.sh

# Test the helper directly
python3 scripts/utilities/helpers/read_eurostyle_dbs.py
```

## Future Extensibility

The system can now:
- Automatically detect new databases added to the YAML config
- Support alternate configuration files via command-line arguments
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for validation
