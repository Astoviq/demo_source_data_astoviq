  sum(subtotal_eur) as operational_revenue,
  (SELECT sum(credit_amount) FROM eurostyle_finance.gl_journal_lines WHERE account_id = '4000') as finance_revenue,
  CASE WHEN sum(subtotal_eur) = (SELECT sum(credit_amount) FROM eurostyle_finance.gl_journal_lines WHERE account_id = '4000') 
       THEN '✅ PERFECT MATCH' ELSE '❌ MISMATCH' END as status
FROM eurostyle_operational.orders"
```

### 5. Stop the System

```bash
# Stop containers (preserve data)
./eurostyle.sh stop

# Clean all data
./eurostyle.sh clean --force
```

## 🔄 Incremental Data Generation - Complete Business Operations

### Overview
Simulate realistic daily business operations with both **new records** and **updates to existing data**. Generate new orders, customer registrations, webshop sessions, plus operational changes like product price updates, employee promotions, and customer loyalty upgrades that maintain **perfect consistency**.

### Key Features
- **✅ Perfect Continuity**: New data continues existing ID sequences (e.g., orders 005001, 005002...)
- **✅ Referential Integrity**: Uses existing customers, products, and stores
- **✅ GL Consistency**: Every new order generates matching finance entries
- **✅ Realistic Business Updates**: Price changes, employee promotions, loyalty upgrades
- **✅ Automatic Loading**: Data is automatically loaded into ClickHouse after generation
- **✅ Business Logic**: VAT calculation, shipping rules, store assignments, promotion logic

### 🆕 Enhanced Quick Examples (Unified Commands)

```bash
# Complete business day (new records + updates) - RECOMMENDED
./eurostyle.sh increment --days 1

# Multi-day business growth simulation with automatic loading
./eurostyle.sh increment --days 7 --intensity normal

# Black Friday simulation (high volume)
./eurostyle.sh increment --days 1 --intensity heavy

# Specific update operations only
./eurostyle.sh increment --types "customer_updates,product_updates" --days 1
./eurostyle.sh increment --types "employee_updates" --days 1

# New records only (classic incremental)
./eurostyle.sh increment --types "orders,customers,sessions" --days 3
```

### 🔧 Advanced Generator Usage (Direct)

```bash
# Direct generator usage for advanced scenarios
python3 scripts/data-generation/universal_incremental_generator.py --days 1
python3 scripts/data-generation/universal_incremental_generator.py --days 1 --intensity heavy
python3 scripts/data-generation/universal_incremental_generator.py --types "customer_updates" --days 1
python3 scripts/data-generation/universal_incremental_generator.py --update-only --types "employee_updates" --days 1
```

### 📊 Enhanced Daily Business Activity Volumes

| Intensity | New Records | Update Operations | Revenue/Day |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| | Orders/Customers/Sessions | Customer/Product/Employee Updates | |
| **Light** | 50/10/250 | 25/15/3 | ~€20K |
| **Normal** | 100/20/500 | 50/30/5 | ~€40K |
| **Heavy** | 200/40/1000 | 100/60/10 | ~€80K |

**Update Operations Include:**
- **Customer Updates**: Address changes, loyalty upgrades, preference changes
- **Product Updates**: Price adjustments, stock updates, seasonal changes, cost price updates
- **Employee Updates**: Salary increases/promotions, status changes, visa updates

### 📥 Automated Incremental Data Loading

**✅ AUTOMATIC (Recommended)**: Loading happens automatically when using `./eurostyle.sh increment`

**🔧 MANUAL (Advanced)**: For manual control or troubleshooting
```bash
# Load all incremental data files (both new records and updates)
bash scripts/data-loading/load_incremental_data.sh

# Verify system status after loading
./eurostyle.sh status
```

**👀 What Gets Loaded Automatically:**
- `*_incremental.csv.gz` → New records (orders, customers, sessions, GL entries)
- `*_updates.csv.gz` → Updates to existing records (customers, products, employees)
- Complex table names supported (e.g., `gl_journal_headers_incremental.csv.gz`)
- Automatic database status reporting after successful loading

### Business Scenarios

**📈 Growth Simulation**
```bash
# Simulate 30 days of steady growth
for i in {1..30}; do
  python3 scripts/data-generation/universal_incremental_generator.py --days 1 --intensity normal

done
```

**🛍️ Seasonal Peak (Black Friday)**
```bash
