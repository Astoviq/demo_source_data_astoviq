# Universal Data Generator V2 - HR Enhancement

## Overview

The Universal Data Generator V2 has been successfully enhanced to include comprehensive HR training, survey, and performance management capabilities. This enhancement extends the existing framework to generate realistic European HR data that complies with GDPR and employment law requirements.

## üéØ What Was Added

### 1. HR Training System
- **Training Programs Catalog**: Realistic training programs across multiple categories
- **Employee Training Records**: Enrollment, completion, and certification tracking
- **European Compliance**: Mandatory GDPR, safety, and regulatory training
- **Business Logic**: Role-based training assignments and completion patterns

### 2. Employee Survey System

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Implementation

### Configuration-Driven Approach
Following WARP.md Rule #6, all HR patterns and business logic are externalized to YAML configuration files:

```
config/data_patterns/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hr_training_patterns.yaml     # Training programs and enrollment patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hr_survey_patterns.yaml       # Survey types and response patterns  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hr_performance_patterns.yaml  # Performance cycles and review patterns
```

### Data Generation Workflow
The enhanced generator follows a structured approach:

```python
# Phase 4: HR training, surveys and performance data  
self.generate_training_programs(mode)
self.generate_employee_training_records(mode)
self.generate_employee_surveys(mode)
self.generate_survey_responses(mode)
self.generate_performance_cycles(mode)
self.generate_performance_reviews(mode)
```
