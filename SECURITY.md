# 🔒 Security Guidelines

## 🎯 Demo Repository Security

This is a **demonstration repository** designed for learning and testing. While it uses demo data, proper security practices should still be followed.

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

### 🔑 Credentials & Authentication

**Demo Credentials (Safe for Public Use)**:
- Username: `eurostyle_user`
- Default Password: `eurostyle_demo_2024`
- Database: Local development only
- Ports: `8124` (HTTP), `9002` (Native)

**⚠️ These credentials are:**
- ✅ **Safe for demos** - No real data or systems
- ✅ **Local containers only** - Not exposed to internet
- ✅ **Isolated ports** - Non-standard ports to avoid conflicts

### 🛡️ Best Practices Implemented

#### Environment Configuration
- **`.env` files ignored** - Never committed to repository
- **`.env.example`** provided as template
- **No hardcoded secrets** in code

#### Container Security
- **Isolated network** - Custom Docker network `eurostyle_retail_network`
- **Non-standard ports** - `8124`/`9002` instead of defaults
- **Memory limits** - Controlled resource usage
- **Local-only binding** - Not exposed beyond localhost

#### Data Security
- **Synthetic data only** - No real customer/business data
- **GDPR-compliant patterns** - European privacy standards
- **Demo-safe schemas** - No sensitive field structures

## 🚫 What's NOT Secure (By Design)

This demo intentionally uses simplified security for ease of use:

### Known Limitations
- **Weak demo password** - `eurostyle_demo_2024` is simple
- **No TLS/SSL** - HTTP connections for local development
- **Basic authentication** - No OAuth/LDAP integration
- **No data encryption** - Demo data doesn't require it

## 🏭 Production Deployment Security

**⚠️ NEVER use this configuration in production!**

For production deployments, implement:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strong passwords** - Complex, unique credentials
- **TLS/SSL certificates** - HTTPS/secure connections
- **Role-based access** - Principle of least privilege
- **Multi-factor authentication** - Where applicable

### Network Security
- **Private networks** - VPC/subnet isolation
- **Firewall rules** - Restrict access to necessary IPs
- **Load balancers** - With security headers
- **VPN access** - For administrative access

### Data Protection
- **Data encryption** - At rest and in transit
- **Backup encryption** - Secure backup strategies
- **Access logging** - Audit trail for all access
- **Data retention policies** - Compliance with regulations

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container scanning** - Vulnerability assessments
- **Regular updates** - OS and application patches
- **Secrets management** - HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
- **Network monitoring** - Intrusion detection systems

## 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before contributing:

- [ ] **No real credentials** in commits
- [ ] **`.env` files ignored** and not committed
- [ ] **Demo data only** - no real business information
- [ ] **Local testing** - verify containers are local-only
- [ ] **Security scan** - check for common vulnerabilities

## 🐛 Reporting Security Issues

Even in demo repositories, security matters:

### How to Report
1. **Create a private issue** (don't publish vulnerabilities)
2. **Email maintainers** if critical
3. **Provide details** - clear reproduction steps
4. **Suggest solutions** if possible

### What to Report
- **Credential leaks** in repository
- **Container escape** vulnerabilities
- **Network exposure** beyond localhost
- **Data leakage** patterns

## 🎓 Learning Security

This demo can help you learn secure practices:

### Security Patterns Demonstrated
- **Environment variable management**
- **Container network isolation**
- **Database user permissions**
- **Synthetic data generation**

### Security Tools to Explore
```bash
# Scan for secrets in git history
git secrets --scan-history

# Check for exposed ports
nmap localhost

# Analyze Docker containers
docker scan eurostyle_clickhouse_retail

# Check environment variables
docker exec eurostyle_clickhouse_retail env
```

## ✅ Security Summary

**This demo is secure for its intended purpose**:
- 🏠 **Local development only**
- 🧪 **Synthetic demo data**
- 🔒 **Isolated containers**
- 📚 **Educational use**

**Remember**: Always implement proper security practices in production environments!
