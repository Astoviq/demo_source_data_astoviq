# HR Training & Survey Data Implementation Plan

**Project**: EuroStyle Fashion HR Training & Survey Data Generation  
**Purpose**: Fill empty HR tables (training_programs, employee_training, employee_surveys, survey_responses, performance_reviews)  
**Approach**: Configuration-driven development following WARP.md rules  
**Target Tables**: 5 empty tables + enhancement of 1 low-data table (performance_cycles)  

---

## üéØ WARP.md Rules Compliance

### Rule #6: Data Pattern Configuration
All HR training and survey patterns will be externalized to YAML configuration files:

```yaml
# config/data_patterns/hr_training_patterns.yaml
# config/data_patterns/hr_survey_patterns.yaml  
# config/data_patterns/hr_performance_patterns.yaml
```

### Rule #9: Universal Generator Extension
Extend existing Universal Data Generator V2 to include HR training/survey capabilities:

```python
# Enhancement to scripts/data-generation/universal_data_generator_v2.py
# New methods: generate_hr_training_data(), generate_hr_survey_data(), generate_hr_performance_data()
```

### Rule #23: Documentation Synchronization
All documentation must be updated simultaneously with code changes.

## üìä Current State Analysis

**Empty Tables Requiring Data:**
- `training_programs` (0 rows) - Training program catalog
- `employee_training` (0 rows) - Employee training records
- `employee_surveys` (0 rows) - Survey definitions  
- `survey_responses` (0 rows) - Employee survey responses
- `performance_reviews` (0 rows) - Performance review records

**Low-Data Tables Requiring Enhancement:**
- `performance_cycles` (2 rows) - Should have annual cycles for multiple years

**Populated Tables for Reference:**
- `employees` (830 rows) - Training participants
- `departments` (60 rows) - Training audience segmentation
- `job_positions` (188 rows) - Role-based training requirements

### Phase 2: Universal Data Generator V2 Extension

#### 2.1 Core Generator Enhancement
**File**: `scripts/data-generation/universal_data_generator_v2.py`

Add new methods to the existing UniversalDataGeneratorV2 class:

```python
def generate_hr_training_data(self):
    """Generate HR training programs and employee training records"""
    self.generate_training_programs()
    self.generate_employee_training_records()
    
def generate_hr_survey_data(self):
    """Generate employee surveys and survey responses"""
    self.generate_employee_surveys()
    self.generate_survey_responses()
    
def generate_hr_performance_data(self):
    """Generate performance cycles and performance reviews"""
    self.enhance_performance_cycles()
    self.generate_performance_reviews()
```

#### 2.2 Training Programs Generation
```python
def generate_training_programs(self):
    """Generate comprehensive training program catalog"""
    # Load configuration
    patterns = self.load_config('hr_training_patterns.yaml')
    
    # Generate programs by category
    programs = []
    for category, percentage in patterns['program_distribution'].items():
        program_count = int(self.target_programs * percentage)
        programs.extend(self.create_training_programs_by_category(category, program_count))
    
    # Ensure mandatory European compliance programs exist
    programs.extend(self.create_mandatory_compliance_programs())
    
    # Save to CSV
    self.save_to_csv('eurostyle_hr.training_programs', programs)
```

#### 2.3 Employee Training Records Generation
```python
def generate_employee_training_records(self):
    """Generate realistic employee training enrollment and completion records"""
    # Get existing employees and training programs
    employees = self.get_existing_employees()
    programs = self.get_training_programs()
    
    training_records = []
    for employee in employees:
        # Determine training load based on role and department
        annual_training_count = self.calculate_training_load(employee)
        
        # Assign training programs
        assigned_programs = self.assign_training_programs(employee, programs, annual_training_count)
        
        for program in assigned_programs:
            record = self.create_training_record(employee, program)
            training_records.append(record)
    
    # Save to CSV
    self.save_to_csv('eurostyle_hr.employee_training', training_records)
```

### Phase 3: Data Relationships and Integrity

#### 3.1 Foreign Key Relationships
```yaml
# config/relationships/hr_training_survey_relationships.yaml
hr_training_relationships:
  employee_training.employee_id: eurostyle_hr.employees.employee_id
  employee_training.program_id: eurostyle_hr.training_programs.program_id
  
hr_survey_relationships:
  survey_responses.survey_id: eurostyle_hr.employee_surveys.survey_id
  survey_responses.employee_id: eurostyle_hr.employees.employee_id  # Nullable for anonymous
  
hr_performance_relationships:
  performance_reviews.employee_id: eurostyle_hr.employees.employee_id
  performance_reviews.reviewer_employee_id: eurostyle_hr.employees.employee_id
  performance_reviews.cycle_id: eurostyle_hr.performance_cycles.cycle_id
```

#### 3.2 Business Logic Rules
```yaml
# config/business_rules/hr_training_survey_rules.yaml
training_business_rules:
  mandatory_compliance_training:
    - All employees must complete GDPR training within 30 days of hire
    - Managers must complete leadership training within 90 days of promotion
    - Safety training required for operations roles
    
  certification_tracking:
    - Technical certifications expire and require renewal
    - Compliance training has mandatory renewal periods
    - Failed training requires retaking within 30 days
    
survey_business_rules:
  anonymization_requirements:
    - GDPR compliance: Allow full anonymization
    - Department-level aggregation for reporting
    - Individual responses protected by privacy rules
    
  response_validation:
    - Ratings must be 1-5 scale
    - Text responses require content moderation
    - Exit interviews link to employment termination dates
    
performance_business_rules:
  review_cycle_requirements:
    - Annual reviews mandatory for all employees
    - Self-assessment required before manager review
    - HR approval required before finalization
    - Employee acknowledgment completes the process
    
  rating_calibration:
    - Rating distribution should follow normal curve
    - Exceptional ratings require additional justification
    - Performance improvement plans trigger HR involvement
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### European Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR**: Survey responses must support anonymization
- **Employment Law**: Training requirements vary by country (DE, FR, NL, BE)
- **Certification Standards**: European professional certifications tracking
- **Language Support**: Multi-language training content for international employees

### Performance Optimization
- **Bulk Generation**: Generate training records in batches by department
- **Memory Management**: Stream large survey response datasets
- **Index Strategy**: Optimize for common query patterns (employee, date ranges)

### Data Consistency Patterns
- **Training Costs**: Generate matching GL entries in Finance database
- **Completion Tracking**: Link to payroll records for training time
- **Promotion Tracking**: Connect performance reviews to salary changes
